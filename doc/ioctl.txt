ioctl()
========

The most common use of ioctl is to control hardware devices.

An ioctl interface is a single system call by which userspace may
communicate with device drivers.


An ioctl call takes as parameters:
  1. an open file descriptor
  2. a request code number
  3. either an integer value or a pointer.


int ioctl(int d, int request, ...); 

  1st argument d: must be an open file descriptor.
  2nd argument request: device-dependent request code.
  3rd argument: untyped pointer to memory.
